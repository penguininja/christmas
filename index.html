        <h3 class="section-title">Intro</h3>
        <p>I don't want a lot for Christmas<br/>
        There is just one thing I need<br/>
        I don't care about the presents<br/>
        Underneath the Christmas tree<br/>
        <p>I don't need to hang my stocking<br/>
        There upon the fireplace<br/>
        Santa Claus won't make me happy<br/>
        With a toy on Christmas day</p>

        <h3 class="section-title">Chorus</h3>
        <p>I just want you for my own<br/>
        More than you could ever know<br/>
        Make my wish come true<br/>
        All I want for Christmas is you<br/>
        You, baby</p> 

        <h3 class="section-title">Verse 1</h3>
        <p>I won't ask for much this Christmas<br/>
        I won't even wish for snow.<br/>
        And I'm just gonna keep on waiting<br/>
        Underneath the mistletoe<br/>
        <p>I won't make a list and send it<br/>
        To the North Pole for St. Nick.<br/>
        I won't even stay awake<br/>
        To hear those magic reindeer click.</p>

        <h3 class="section-title">Chorus</h3>
        <p>I just want you here tonight<br/>
        Holding on to me so tight<br/>
        What more can I do?<br/>
        All I want for Christmas is you<br/>
        You, baby</p>

        <h3 class="section-title">Bridge</h3>
        <p>Oh, all the lights are shining<br/>
        So brightly everywhere<br/>
        And the sound of children's<br/>
        Laughter fills the air<br/>
        And everyone is singing<br/>
        I hear those sleigh bells ringing<br/>
        Santa, won't you bring me<br/>
        The one I really need?<br/>
        Won't you please bring my baby to me?</p>        

        <h3 class="section-title">Verse 3</h3>
        <p>Oh, I don't want a lot for Christmas<br/>
        This is all I'm asking for<br/>
        I just wanna see my baby<br/>
        Standing right outside my door</p>

        <h3 class="section-title">Chorus</h3>
        <p>Oh, I just want you for my own<br/>
        More than you could ever know<br/>
        Make my wish come true<br/>
        Oh baby, all I want for Christmas is you</p>

        <h3 class="section-title">Outro</h3>
        <p>You, baby<br/>
        All I want for Christmas is you, baby<br/>
        All I want for Christmas is you, baby<br/>
        All I want for Christmas is you, baby</p>

        <h2 class="song-title" id="frosty-the-snowman">Frosty the Snowman</h2>
        <h3 class="section-title">Verse 1</h3>
        <p>Frosty the snowman was a jolly happy soul<br/>
        With a corncob pipe and a button nose<br/>
        And two eyes made out of coal<br/><p>
        <p>Frosty the snowman is a fairy tale, they say<br/>
        He was made of snow but the children know<br/>
        How he came to life one day</p>
        <p>There must have been some magic in<br/>
        That old silk hat they found<br/>
        For when they placed it on his head<br/>
        He began to dance around</p>
        <p>Oh, Frosty the snowman<br/>
        Was alive as he could be<br/>
        And the children say he could laugh and play<br/>
        Just the same as you and me</p>

        <h3 class="section-title">Verse 2</h3>
        <p>Ooh Frosty the snowman<br/>
        Knew the sun was hot that day<br/>
        So he said, "Let's run and we'll have some fun<br/>
        Now before I melt away."</p>
        <p>Down to the village<br/>
        With a broomstick in his hand<br/>
        Running here and there all around the square<br/>
        Saying "catch me if you can!"</p>
        <p>He led them down the streets of town<br/>
        Right to the traffic cop<br/>
        And he only paused a moment when<br/>
        He heard him holler "Stop!"</p>
        <p>Oh, Frosty the snowman<br/>
        Had to hurry on his way<br/>
        But he waved goodbye, saying<br/>
        "Don't you cry, I'll be back again someday."</p>

        <h3 class="section-title">Chorus</h3>
        <p>Thumpety thump thump<br/>
        Thumpety thump thump<br/>
        Look at Frosty go<br/>
        Thumpety thump thump<br/>
        Thumpety thump thump<br/>
        Over the hills of snow!</p>

        <h3 class="section-title">Chorus</h3>
        <p>Grandma got run over by a reindeer<br/>
        Walking home from our house Christmas eve.<br/>
        You can say there's no such thing as Santa,<br/>
        But as for me and Grandpa, we believe.</p>

        <h3 class="section-title">Verse 1</h3>
        <p>She'd been drinkin' too much egg nog,<br/>
        And we'd begged her not to go.<br/>
        But she'd left her medication,<br/>
        So she stumbled out the door into the snow.</p>
        <p>When they found her Christmas mornin',<br/>
        At the scene of the attack.<br/>
        There were hoof prints on her forehead,<br/>
        And incriminating Claus marks on her back.</p>

        <h3 class="section-title">Chorus</h3>
        <p>Grandma got run over by a reindeer,<br/>
        Walkin' home from our house Christmas eve.<br/>
        You can say there's no such thing as Santa,<br/>
        But as for me and Grandpa, we believe.</p>

        <h3 class="section-title">Verse 2</h3>
        <p>Now were all so proud of Grandpa,<br/>
        He's been takin' this so well.<br/>
        See him in there watchin' football,<br/>
        Drinkin' beer and playin' cards with cousin Belle.</p>
        <p>It's not Christmas without Grandma.<br/>
        All the family's dressed in black.<br/>
        And we just can't help but wonder:<br/>
        Should we open up her gifts or send them back?</p>

        <h3 class="section-title">Chorus</h3>
        <p>Grandma got run over by a reindeer,<br/>
        Walkin' home from our house Christmas eve.<br/>
        You can say there's no such thing as Santa,<br/>
        But as for me and Grandpa, we believe.</p>

        <h3 class="section-title">Verse 3</h3>
        <p>Now the goose is on the table<br/>
        And the pudding made of fig.<br/>
        And a blue and silver candle,<br/>
        That would just have matched the hair in Grandma's wig.</p>
        <p>I've warned all my friends and neighbours.<br/>
        "Better watch out for yourselves."<br/>
        They should never give a license,<br/>
        To a man who drives a sleigh and plays with elves.</p>

        <h3 class="section-title">Chorus</h3>
        <p>Grandma got run over by a reindeer,<br/>
        Walkin' home from our house, Christmas eve.<br/>
        You can say there's no such thing as Santa,<br/>
        But as for me and Grandpa, we believe.</p>

        <p>I want a hippopotamus for Christmas<br/>
        Only a hippopotamus will do<br/>
        I don't want a doll, no dinky Tinkertoy<br/>
        I want a hippopotamus to play with and enjoy</p>
        <p>I want a hippopotamus for Christmas<br/>
        I don't think Santa Claus will mind, do you?<br/>
        He won't have to use our dirty chimney flue<br/>
        Just bring him through the front door<br/>
        That's the easy thing to do</p>

        <h3 class="section-title">Bridge 1</h3>
        <p>I can see me now on Christmas morning<br/>
        Creeping down the stairs<br/>
        Oh, what joy and what surprise<br/>
        When I open up my eyes<br/>
        To see my hippo hero standing there</p>

        <h3 class="section-title">Verse 2</h3>
        <p>I want a hippopotamus for Christmas<br/>
        Only a hippopotamus will do<br/>
        No crocodiles, or rhinoceroseses<br/>
        I only like hippopotamuseses<br/>
        And hippopotamuses like me too</p>
        <p>I want a hippopotamus for Christmas<br/>
        A hippopotamus is all I want<br/>
        Mom says the hippo would eat me up<br/>
        But then teacher says a hippo is a vegetarian</p>

        <h3 class="section-title">Verse 5</h3>
        <p>I want a hippopotamus for Christmas<br/>
        The kind I saw this summer at the zoo<br/>
        There's lots of room for him in our two car garage<br/>
        I'd feed him there and wash him there<br/>
        And give him his massage</p>

        <p>I can see me now on Christmas morning<br/>

        <h3 class="section-title">Verse 1</h3>
        <p>It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas<br/>
        Everywhere you go<br/>
        Take a look at the five and ten, it's glistening once again<br/>
        With candy canes and silver lanes that glow</p>
        <p>It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas<br/>
        Toys in every store<br/>
        But the prettiest sight to see is the holly that will be<br/>
        On your own front door</p>

        <h3 class="section-title">Bridge</h3>
        <p>A pair of Hopalong boots and a pistol that shoots<br/>
        Is the wish of Barney and Ben<br/>
        Dolls that'll talk and will go for a walk<br/>
        Is the hope of Janice and Jen<br/>
        And Mom and Dad can hardly wait for school to start again</p>

        <h3 class="section-title">Verse 3</h3>
        <p>It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas<br/>
        Everywhere you go<br/>
        There's a tree in the Grand Hotel, one in the park as well<br/>
        It's the sturdy kind that doesn't mind the snow</p>
        <p>It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas<br/>
        Soon the bells will start<br/>
        And the thing that'll make 'em ring<br/>
        Is the carol that you sing<br/>
        Right within your heart<br/>
        Right within your heart</p>

        The lights are turned way down low<br/>
        Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow</p>

        <h3 class="section-title">Bridge</h3>
        <p>When we finally kiss goodnight<br/>
        How you'll hate going out in the storm<br/>
        But if you really hold me tight<br/>
        All the way home you'll be warm</p>

        <h3 class="section-title">Verse 3</h3>
        <p>The fire is slowly dying<br/>
        And, dear, we're still goodbying<br/>
        But as long as you love me so<br/>
        Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow</p>

        <h3 class="section-title">Verse 1</h3>
        <p>Rockin' around the Christmas tree<br/>
        At the Christmas party hop<br/>
        Mistletoe hung where you can see<br/>
        Every couple tries to stop</p>

        <h3 class="section-title">Verse 2</h3>        
        <p>Rockin' around the Christmas tree<br/>
        Let the Christmas spirit ring<br/>
        Later we'll have some pumpkin pie<br/>
        And we'll do some caroling</p>

        <h3 class="section-title">Chorus</h3>        
        <p>You will get a sentimental feeling when you hear<br/>
        Voices singing, let's be jolly<br/>
        Deck the halls with boughs of holly</p>

        <h3 class="section-title">Verse 3</h3>    
        <p>Rockin' around the Christmas tree<br/>
        Have a happy holiday<br/>
        Everyone dancin' merrily<br/>
        In the new old-fashioned way</p>

        <h3 class="section-title">Intro</h3>
        <p>You know Dasher and Dancer and Prancer and Vixen<br/>
        Comet and Cupid and Donner and Blitzen<br/>
        But do you recall<br/>
        The most famous reindeer of all?</p>

        <h3 class="section-title">Verse 1</h3>
        <p>Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer<br/>
        Had a very shiny nose<br/>
        And if you ever saw it<br/>
        You would even say it glows</p>
        <p>All of the other reindeer<br/>
        Used to laugh and call him names<br/>
        They never let poor Rudolph<br/>
        Join in any reindeer games</p>

        <h3 class="section-title">Bridge</h3>
        <p>Then one foggy Christmas Eve<br/>
        Santa came to say<br/>
        "Rudolph, with your nose so bright<br/>
        Won't you guide my sleigh tonight?"</p>

        <h3 class="section-title">Outro</h3>
        <p>Then how the reindeer loved him<br/>
        As they shouted out with glee<br/>
        "Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer<br/>
        You'll go down in history"<br/>
        You'll go down in history"</p>

        <h3 class="section-title">Bridge</h3>
        <p>Come and trim my Christmas tree<br/>

        <h3 class="section-title">Outro</h3>
        <p>Santa baby,<br/>
        forgot to mention one little thing<br/>
        A ring, I don't mean on the phone<br/>
        Santa baby,<br/>

        Hurry down the chimney tonight<br/>
